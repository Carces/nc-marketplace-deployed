# Documentation

Uses a pre-made back-end API supplied by Northcoders: https://nc-marketplace-sem-4.onrender.com/docs/api-ref/

This API was shared between the members of our bootcamp cohort. All data is dummy data created by other bootcamp students.

The front-end web app was built using create-react-app, and axios was used for making calls to the back-end API.

## Limitations

User authentication has not been implemented - user login and registration is done using unsecured axios API calls.

The back-end API is hosted using the free tier of Render, which means that the API is suspended when not in use.
As a result, the first time you view the web app, it may take around 30 seconds for the API to start up and begin supplying data.

Dummy data in the back-end database was created by others and may include some nonsensical entries.

# Credits

NC Marketplace was originally produced as part of a pair-programming task for the Northcoders software development bootcamp.
Most of the initial development was done together with my partner Reem (https://github.com/reemhd)

The back-end API was supplied by Northcoders, and includes data created by other members of the Northcoders January 2023 cohort.
